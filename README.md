# thinking-in-marte

My first book on the Multi-threaded Application for Real-Time execution (MARTe) framework.

## Background and Credit

MARTe has been developed since the early 2000s by a very creative team of engineers, most 
working in Fusion Energy research.  A starting point to find out more is https://github.com/aneto0/MARTe2

For other MARTe/2 resources see [MARTe2-resources](MARTe2_Resources.md)

## Examples

A minimal demonstration of the LinuxTimer generating outputs at 1Hz and providing `Counter` and `Time` 
to the console via a Logger.

#### LinuxTimer-2

A minimal demonstration of the LinuxTimer generating outputs at 1Hz and providing `Counter` and `Time`
